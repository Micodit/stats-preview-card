### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to use SASS, especially `@use` and `@forward` instead of `@import`. I also learnt how to organize SASS code using the 7-1 pattern architechture.

### Continued development

I want to practice further with SASS, espcially the advanced useage of mixins and functions.

I also want to improve my ability of controlling images in my projects. Currently, sometimes I couldn't control them as expected.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) - This helped me to understand the 7-1 pattern further.
